			<h3>Self-help and lifestyle changes</h3>		
			<h4>Introduction</h4>		
		<p>There is no one-size-fits-all prescription for the treatment of depression. For most patients, the best way to help yourself is to establish a friendly emotional relationship, make lifestyle changes and seek professional help.</p>		
			<h4>Build friendly emotional relationships and don't let anxiety control your life.</h4>		
		<p>This approach helps to build supportive relationships that make it easier to seek social support and help.</p><p>Having depression does not mean that you are very weak. Helplessness and panic are among the symptoms of depression, not because of your personality. Let your family and friends know about your current mental state so they can know how to help you. A strong social support system will allow you to recover faster.</p><p>The key to treating depression can start with the following small things.</p>		
												<a href="">Socratic Questioning</a>
					<p>Socratic Questioning is a very effective cognitive restructuring technique that can help you to challenge irrational, illogical, or harmful thinking errors.</p>
												<a href="">The basic outline for this technique is to ask the following questions: </a>
					<ul><li>Is this thought realistic?</li><li>Am I basing my thoughts on facts or on feelings?</li><li>What is the evidence for this thought?</li><li>Could I be misinterpreting the evidence?</li><li>Am I viewing the situation as black and white when it’s more complicated?</li><li>Am I having this thought out of habit, or do facts support it?</li></ul>
												<a href="">Behaviour therapy</a>
					<p>The aim of behaviour therapy is to teach the person techniques or skills to alter their behaviour.</p>
