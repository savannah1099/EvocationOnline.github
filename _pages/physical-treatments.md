			<h2>Drug treatments</h2>		
		<p>Taking medication is one of the most direct ways to treat depression, but you should thoroughly consult a professional psychologist before taking it, and take depression medication under the supervision of the psychologist.</p><p>Some medications have side effects. Your doctor will discuss with you the risks and benefits of the medications, side effects, and how often you need to be checked. It is also important to know that not all types of depression require medication. Some people respond to lifestyle changes and psychotherapy. It may take some time for the drug to start working. Do not stop taking the medicine suddenly without consulting a doctor.</p>

			<h2>Electroconvulsive therapy</h2>		
		<p>ECT is a neurostimulation treatment option for difficult-to-treat depression. ECT is a safe procedure with good patient satisfaction.</p><p>Doctors at the Black Dog Institute have found ECT to be the ‘most effective, proven biological treatment currently available for depression’. ECT has a small but important role in treatment</p><p>Some new types of ECT, such as ultrabrief pulses (ultrabrief ECT) and bifrontal ECT have been shown to have fewer cognitive side effects than standard ECT.</p>

			<h2>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation</h2>		
		<p>Studies at the Black Dog Institute indicate that rTMS has antidepressant effects when applied over the frontal areas of the brain. rTMS is a mild form of brain stimulation. Magnetic fields, generated by a simple coil placed on the head, are used to stimulate a small area of the brain. A session of rTMS takes about 30 minutes; it is typically given over consecutive weekdays for several weeks, on an outpatient basis. While receiving stimulation, the patient is fully awake. rTMS is usually well tolerated with minimal side effects. There is no anaesthetic and memory is not affected.</p><p>rTMS is used to treat depression and can be offered when patients have not responded to antidepressant medication.</p><p>It can also be used if patients prefer to try an alternative to medication, or cannot tolerate antidepressant medications due to side effects.</p>
