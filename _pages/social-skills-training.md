			<h3>Social skills training</h3>		
				Communicate effectively with other people				
			<h4>Introduction</h4>		
		<p>Social loneliness is often accompanied by insufficient social communication skills. Humans are social creatures and thrive on interaction with other people. Good social skills can help people live away from loneliness, even depression. Thus, equipping people who have few social skills with the necessary tools is becoming more and more important.</p>		
			<h4>What are social skills?</h4>		
		<p>Social skills are the behaviours, verbal and non-verbal, that we use to communicate effectively with other people. For example, smiling when greeting people, shaking hands when meeting someone, expressing opinions to others and so on.</p>		
			<h4>Benefit of good social skills</h4>		
		<p>Good social skills can improve social confidence and enable people to communicate more with others that playing a positive role. At the same time, it can also improve students’ academic achievement, conduct in school, at home, and in the community and so on.</p>		
			<h4>How to improve your social skills?</h4>
