			<h4>Why should depression not be ignored?</h4>		
		<p>According to the NAMI study, college students suffering from depression account for 27% of mental illnesses. As international students are in the transition phase from primary to tertiary education, the incidence of depression during this period is relatively high.</p><p>Depression can have a negative effect on international students' academic attendance and completion, quality of life, physical health and satisfaction with their university experience, and form barriers in relationships with friends and family. These issues can also have a long-term impact on students, affecting their future career, earning potential and more.</p>

			<h3>Academics</h3>		
		<p>Depression is one of the main factors leading to college dropouts. It is well documented that depression among international students has been increasing over the last 50 years. Mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety, among university students can prevent them from graduating properly. Surveys by the American College Health Association show that in the past year, 30% of students felt stressed, 22% suffered from persistent anxiety and 20% suffered from insomnia, all of which are signs of depression. Once untreated, the chances of suicide are very high, which can also cause great trauma to friends, family, classmates and teachers.</p>

			<h3>Career</h3>		
		<p>NCHA data shows that 31% of university students have developed a mental illness in the past 12 months and are chronically depressed, making it difficult to function properly. Untreated depression can easily cause daytime fatigue, irritability and difficulty concentrating, and can make it difficult to fall back asleep after waking up at night, a phenomenon that can have serious consequences for their productivity. When students are unable to contribute their full strengths and skills in a competitive job market, not only are they out of work, but communities and companies are also negatively affected. Statistics from the American Journal of Psychiatry found that 5% of international students with depression do not graduate from university, and it is estimated that 4.29 million people would have graduated from university if not for this illness.</p>
