			<h3>How can you work better under pressure?</h3>		
			<h3>5 ways to perform under pressure</h3>		
                        <h3>1. Prepare, then prepare some more</h3>
                                 <p>A lot of the “stage fright” type fear that arises when we are forced to perform comes from worry that we aren’t prepared — that we’ll forget our lines, sound like an idiot, our tech won’t work or we’ll fall off the stage. The best way to address this fear is to practice. Practice a presentation forwards and backwards (literally). Test out all the tech beforehand. Walk the stage. Whatever you can do to feel as prepared as possible.</p>
                        <h3>2. Play “What if?”</h3>
                                 <p>It seems counter-intuitive, but go ahead and let your mind wander and think of all the worst possible things that can go wrong. Go wild! Imagine your computer catching fire, the boss falling asleep, the crowd booing you. Imagine how you will handle each situation and succeed. I can practically guarantee that if anything does go wrong, it won’t be as bad as the scenarios you dreamed up — and you’ll already have thought about how to handle it with grace.</p>
                        <h3>3. Mentally rehearse</h3>
                                 <p>Once you’ve played the what if game and taken it out to its most ridiculous conclusions — stop it. Focusing on what could go wrong directly leading up to your performance is just about the worst thing you could do. Instead, in the days and hours leading up to your moment, visualise yourself knocking it out of the park. If that feels hard, bring to mind past successes and really focus on the details: sights, smells, sounds, feelings. Inhabit these visualisations as fully as possible.</p>
                        <h3>4. Use positive self-talk</h3>
                                 <p>If your mind is playing a constant litany of negative thoughts — “I’m going to fail. They’re all going to laugh at me. I’ll never live this down,” — it will just increase your stress levels. Instead, give yourself one to three positive mantras like “breathe,” “stay focused,” and “be your best,” to give yourself something positive to focus on.</p>
                        <h3>5. Eliminate as many variables as possible with routines</h3>
                                 <p>You don’t want to be searching your house for your keys before a big interview or panicking when your computer crashes moments before a presentation. You can help eliminate these sorts of negative variables by setting up a “pre-game” routine. Lay out your clothes, car keys, phone, etc. the night before an important interview. Make backup copies of presentations, print hard copies, or know where you can borrow extra tech before a presentation. Experienced photographers and event planners often have an “emergency kit” they bring to every job full of random bits like tape, hair pins, extra batteries, and breath mints — things they know from experience they might need. Build your own emergency kit for any high-pressure situation.</p>
