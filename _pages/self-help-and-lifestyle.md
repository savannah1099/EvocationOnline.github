			<h3>Self-help and change in lifestyle</h3>		
			<h3>Introduction</h3>		
		<p>There is no one-size-fits-all prescription for the treatment of depression. For most sufferers, the best way to help themselves is to establish <strong>a friendly emotional relationship</strong>, <strong>lifestyle changes</strong>, <strong>mindset changes</strong> and <strong>seeking professional help</strong>.</p>		
			<h3>1. Build friendly emotional relationships and don't let anxiety control your life.</h3>		
		<p>This approach helps to build supportive relationships that make it easier to seek social support and help.</p><p>Having depression does not mean that you are very weak. Helplessness and panic are among the symptoms of depression, not because of your personality. Let your family and friends know about your current mental state so they can know how to help you. A strong social support system will allow you to recover faster.</p>

												<a href="">The key to treating depression can start with the following small things:</a>
					</h3>
					<ul><li>Expressing and talking about your anxiety. Find supportive friends.</li><li>Ask those around you for reminders when emotions are out of control.</li><li>Face your own fears. Try things outside your comfort zone.</li><li>Accept your imperfections without achieving perfection in everything.</li><li>Set small but achievable goals. Don&#8217;t give up and keep going.</li><li>Engage more with positive people and develop a positive way of thinking.</li></ul>
			<h3>2. Make a shift to a healthy lifestyle.</h3>		
		<p>Lifestyle changes are not something to be taken lightly, but when a poor lifestyle is seriously affecting your recovery, it is important to make changes.</p><p>Having healthy exercise, sleep and eating habits is very effective. The following <strong>tips</strong> can help you:</p>		
					<h3 id="elementor-tab-title-1051" data-tab="1" role="tab" aria-controls="elementor-tab-content-1051" aria-expanded="false">
												<a href="">Exercise regularly, which helps establish regular sleep habits.</a>
					</h3>
					<p><strong>You don&#8217;t need to spend hours in your busy day training at the gym or running long distances; 30 minutes of moderate exercise five times a week is enough.</strong> For example, if you don&#8217;t have time for a 15- or 30-minute workout, or if you have to take a break every 5 or 10 minutes, that&#8217;s okay. Start with 5 or 10 minutes of exercise and then slowly increase the duration of your workout.</p><p><strong>You don&#8217;t need to do a high intensity workout either.</strong> Exercise in a way that makes you comfortable and relaxed is best. For example, you&#8217;re breathing a little heavier than usual, but not out of breath. You are able to chat with your walking partner, but not sing with ease. Your body feels warmer as you move, but you don&#8217;t overheat or sweat.</p><p><strong>Stick with it, and you&#8217;ll get better sleep.</strong> Even a short workout in the morning or afternoon can help regulate your sleep patterns. If you prefer to work out in the evening, gentle exercises such as yoga can help promote sleep. When you get enough sleep, it reduces irritability, sadness and low mood, and also relieves mental fatigue.</p>
					<h3 id="elementor-tab-title-1052" data-tab="2" role="tab" aria-controls="elementor-tab-content-1052" aria-expanded="false">
												<a href="">Ensure a good and sufficient amount of sleep.</a>
					</h3>
					<p>Having a good quality sleep routine is one of the best means of treating depression. Only when you get enough sleep can you have enough energy to cope with the difficulties and stresses of study, work or life.</p><ul><li><strong>Avoid looking at electronic devices before bed.</strong> Products such as mobile phones, computers and television can affect the production of melatonin and thus the quality of sleep.</li><li><strong>Get a moderate amount of exercise every day.</strong> Exercise is the easiest and least costly way to get better. Exercise for at least 30 minutes a day. Be careful, however, not to exercise within 30 minutes of bedtime, as this may cause you to become increasingly awake.</li><li><strong>Develop a regular sleep schedule.</strong> For example, make sure you wake up at 7am and go to bed at 11pm as this helps to boost melatonin production.</li><li><strong>Maintain a dark environment for falling asleep.</strong> Even faint light can cause melatonin to decrease. Also, keep a small lamp above your bed for nighttime bathroom breaks and do not turn on a light so bright that it stimulates your sleep and makes you excited.</li><li><strong>Don&#8217;t eat two hours before bedtime.</strong> When you sleep, your metabolism is slow and calories are not burned off by your body, which also increases the burden on your liver. This can seriously affect your sleep and make it difficult for you to fall asleep.</li></ul>
					<h3 id="elementor-tab-title-1053" data-tab="3" role="tab" aria-controls="elementor-tab-content-1053" aria-expanded="false">
												<a href="">A healthy diet structure helps improve mood.</a>
					</h3>
					<ul><li><strong>Be sure to eat breakfast every day.</strong> Protein improves your concentration and helps balance your blood sugar and gives your brain the necessary nutrients for optimal brain health. Eggs and cereals are good choices.</li><li><strong>Eat healthy fats.</strong> Salmon, sardines, walnuts, and leafy vegetables are great sources of healthy fats. For oils, olive oil and flax oil are preferred; coconut oil is also an alternative.</li><li><strong>Eat plenty of vegetables and fruits, but try to limit natural sugars and avoid things like dried fruits.</strong> Choose different colored varieties, such as berries, citrus, pomegranates, pears, apples and bananas.</li><li><strong>Stay well hydrated and drink less coffee.</strong> The brain is made up of a high percentage of water. Anything that dehydrates it, such as too much caffeine or alcohol, can impair your cognition and judgment. A common consequence of excessive caffeine use is increased anxiety and insomnia. If your diet contains a lot of caffeine, consider gradually limiting your intake to prevent a difficult withdrawal. Make sure you drink plenty of water throughout the day.</li></ul>
			<h3>3. A shift towards positive thinking.</h3>		
		<p>People who are depressed and anxious tend to have negative thoughts, sometimes called negative thinking. Whether depression causes negative thoughts or vice versa, negative thoughts are not the entire cause of depression, but they are a major contributing factor. Therefore, you should exercise replacing negative thoughts with positive ones.</p><p>When depressed, many people do not realize that their thoughts are negative. It is only when one starts to get rid of depression that one realizes how negative the previous thoughts were.</p><p>We all know that eating food that is not nutritious or rotten every day can damage our health. Likewise, filling your mind with negative thoughts can lead to mental anxiety and depression. Consciously implanting positive content into your thoughts will make your spirit healthier, just like giving your body nutritious food.</p><p>We must be alert to every negative thought that comes to mind. If you want to get rid of your current state of depression, you must pay attention to and deal with these negative thoughts that often bother you and bring toxicity to your psyche. When positive thoughts become a habit, the mood will become positive, feeling confident, happy, motivated, and passionate about life everywhere. This effect enters a virtuous cycle where you become more cheerful and motivated; previous goals are easier to achieve; you also try new and challenging things; you feel happier and more likely to make new friends and get along better with people.</p><blockquote><p><strong>How can you change your negative thoughts?</strong></p></blockquote><p>First, you have to believe that you can change your thinking pattern and change your emotions and feelings by changing it.</p><p>Second, you must do the following two things.</p><ul><li>Monitor your thoughts.</li></ul><p>Learn how to react to various scenarios, such as someone, an occasion, something. Every time you find yourself having a negative thought, stop and take a close look at that particular thought in that particular situation. Ask yourself: Why do I think this way? Is there a reason for thinking this way? After several attempts you will find that, in most cases, your negative thoughts are not justified and have no basis in fact.</p><ul><li>Eliminate negative thoughts quickly.</li></ul><p>Whenever you find yourself having negative thoughts, you should not hesitate to eliminate them and quickly replace them with positive thoughts.</p>

							<h3>This is wrong:</h3><p>I can't do this.</p><h3>This is correct:</h3><p>Why can't I? There is no fact that proves I can't do it. There's no reason why I can't do it do it, so I will do it.</p>
							<h3>This is wrong:</h3><p>I may not like it.</p><h3>This is correct:</h3><p>Why don't I like it? I didn't try it, so how do I know I don't like it? I will try it and see how I feel about it.</p>
							<h3>This is wrong:</h3><p>I don't think they like me.</p><h3>This is correct:</h3><p>How do I know they don't like me? What evidence is there that they don't like me. I can't think of any factual reason, it's just a feeling.</p>
		<p>When you answer and think about what is right, do you understand the usefulness of this approach? Are you noticing an increase in your positive thoughts?</p><p>If you are used to negative thoughts, you will find that negative thoughts are usually motivated by feelings and not based on objective facts. You must replace negative thoughts with positive and constructive ones. Doing this training every day, like working out, will create a habit and the emotions will change with it.</p><p>The first week of training is a painful period because you have to censor your thoughts all the time. Gradually, you will automatically block out unfounded negative thoughts. After a week, you will find that your negative thoughts and emotions disappear. Stick with it, and your thinking habits will change completely.</p><p>Once the pattern of positive thoughts is established, it will keep coming up automatically. People around you will also notice the change, and this wonderful feeling further increases your confidence and hope, making you feel happy and full of joy.</p>
