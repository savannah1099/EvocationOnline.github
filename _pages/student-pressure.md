			<h3>How can you study better under pressure?</h3>		
		<p><strong>Come exam time, having higher than usual stress levels seems to be the new norm amongst students. In fact, many students admit to feeling anxious and overwhelmed as they feel the pressure to succeed and meet their own personal expectations. This is on top of the stress of 2020 and how the school year has changed to accommodate schools, particularly in Victoria.</strong></p>		
			<h3>5 ways to beat exam stress and anxiety</h3>		
                        <h3>1. Treat yourself</h3>
                                 <p>While it can be easy to cast all other responsibilities and your social life aside when your exams are around the corner, it’s important that you still make time for them. As Victoria comes out of lockdown, give yourself time to see your friends. Attending to other areas of your life will allow you to be your best, energised and most happy self, so that you can continue to focus on your studies, revise for your exams, and overall, excel in your final results.</p>
                        <h3>2. Think positive</h3>
                                 <p>Often, it is the pressure we place on ourselves to get a certain grade that can contribute to our levels of stress and anxiety. Furthermore, negative thought patterns often contribute to increased self doubt. While completing an exam can seem daunting, as long as you have studied effectively, there shouldn’t be anything new or too difficult for you to get caught up over. Use your exam as an opportunity to demonstrate your knowledge.</p>
                        <h3>3. Get outdoors</h3>
                                 <p>One of the best ways to manage stress and anxiety is exercise. Getting outdoors for even 15 minutes a day brings numerous health benefits. Go for a walk in your local park, get out your skipping rope, or go for a short bike ride around your neighborhood. All of these are going to get your heart rate up, leaving you feeling more alert, energised and, most importantly, less stressed!</p>
                        <h3>4. Breathe</h3>
                                 <p>Deep breathing is a simple and extremely effective way to help you feel calm and manage stress and anxiety. Try taking a few deep breaths whenever you begin to notice your stress levels rising, such as while you are studying or as you wait to enter the exam venue. To slow down your breathing, inhale to the count of four and exhale to the count of six. When you lengthen your exhalations to be longer than your inhalations, your body begins to switch on your parasympathetic nervous system, which in turn will calm you down.</p>
                        <h3>5. Talk it out</h3>
                                 <p>While all of these strategies can collectively help you to manage stress and anxiety during exam time, for some, feeling stressed or anxious can be an ongoing challenge. Consider talking to someone such as a family member, friend or counsellor about how you are feeling and try to come up with some additional strategies to reduce stress.</p>
