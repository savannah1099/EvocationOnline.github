		<p>Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is a kind of structured psychotherapy that aims to teach us to think life and ourselves in a more positive way based on the understanding that thinking negatively is a bad habit.</p><p>Â Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is efficacious in the prevention of relapse or recurrent episodes of depression. When we experience depression, CBT can help us correct the thinking patterns that we do not notice errors of judgement caused by thinking ourselves and the world in a negative way.</p>
